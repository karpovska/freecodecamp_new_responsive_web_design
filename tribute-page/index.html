        <div id="tribute-info"><b>Roman Tarasovych Ratushnyi</b> (Ukrainian: <b> Рома́н Тара́сович Ра́тушний</b>; 5 July 1997 – 9 June 2022) was a Ukrainian public figure, journalist, theorist of revolutionary neo-urbanism, including total resistance to urban neighborhoods as self-sufficient civic units, and a volunteer soldier. Euromaidan participant, author of original forms of municipal activism and resistance to corruption, which went far beyond environmental issues. He is known for the struggle for the preservation of the capital's Protasiv Yar tract, where he created new, urban traditions of the Kholodnyi Yar revolutionary order. He saw the Ukrainian language as a profound tool for restoring the power of Kyiv in its historical environment, introducing it in informal youth circles. During the full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine, he became known for his direct calls for armed struggle against the Russian people who denied the existence of Ukrainian identity.</br>

Participant in the Russo-Ukrainian War. During the Russian invasion in 2022, he fought as a volunteer in the battle of Kyiv, and later joined the 93rd separate mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces "Kholodnyi Yar" as a military intelligence officer. He died in battle near Izium during the battle of Donbas.</br>

After the publication of the mourning poetry of the classic of Ukrainian literature Lina Kostenko on the death of the Ratushnyi, his figure claims to be one of the symbols of the generation of young warriors of Kyivans.</div>
